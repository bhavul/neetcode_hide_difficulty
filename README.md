# Hide Neetcode Difficulty Level

As the name says, this little extension for Chrome/Edge/Chromium browsers basically hides the difficulty level when you're on Neetcode.

## How to Install?

Currently, I've not turned it into extension or uploaded it to Chrome/Edge store yet. This would be coming soon.

### Manual Install.

1. Clone / Download the repository.  
2. In Chrome, open the Extensions page by clicking the three dots in the upper-right corner, selecting "More tools," and then selecting "Extensions." In Edge, open the Extensions page by clicking the three dots in the upper-right corner, selecting "Extensions," and then selecting "Manage extensions."  
3. Turn on Developer mode by clicking the toggle switch in the upper-right corner of the page.  
4. Click the "Load unpacked" button and select the folder where you saved your extension.  
5. The extension should now be installed and active. Navigate to the URL you specified in your manifest.json file, and the JavaScript code should automatically run in the console.  


### Issues
For now, it just waits for a few seconds since the practice page loads dynamically and never finishes loading. This is a minor UX issue which can be fixed later. Any PRs are welcome too. 

Cheers.
